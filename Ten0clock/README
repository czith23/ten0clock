Overview:

"""
Peak inside the front door of your favorite restaurant, pub, or concert hall
 from the comfort of your couch. Ten0clock is an Android utility that surveys
  nearby venues and gives accurate, real-time descriptions of the action inside.

Check wait-times, menus, crowds, house bands, events, or specials. Ten0clock 
allows users to post to venue specific chatrooms developing a live review board. 
Look at what entres your friends have been eating or the bars they've been frequenting.

With Ten0clock you can schedule public or private events and post them to a venue's 
calendar. Plan game nights, company happy hours, and more. Never leave a crowded restaurant
again; Ten0clock makes it easy to enjoy a night on the town your way.

Installation / running:
1. Be certain that the most recent ADK is installed from within Eclipse.
2. An Android Virtual Device needs to be setup inside of Eclipse to run this program.
This is the best guide for achieving this: https://developer.android.com/tools/devices/index.html
3. From within Eclipse: File -> New -> Other -> Android Project From Existing Code
4. Right click the top level project directory and select "Run as Android Application"

Implementation Portions for this cycle of the project revolved around Database 
setup and GUI initialization.

To view what is currently implemented of the MySQL database use the following credentials:
Server address: 54.84.33.75
Username (read-only): test_user
Password: hopscotch90210

MySQL workbench was used for database development.

For the GUI implementation, the last two weeks of the cycle revolved around research and 
trial and error. The ADK was new to the team as a tool. After working through how to appropriately
 set up an Android Application, It was decided to focus on three distinct
pages and layouts for the GUI. The landing page and registration page are separate from the
innards of the application. Once a user passes these pages navigation is controlled via a 
drawer navigation design, and getting this set up was the main goal of cycle 1.

Navigation from Landing Page to Registration Page to the base NavigationActivity is available.
Various XML layouts were also developed during this cycle.
The application was tested on an Android virtual device.
